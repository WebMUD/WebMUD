# Testing

# How-To

- see [Jest Guide](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) for info on writing tests
- Name test files `<name-of-module>.test.ts`

# Guidelines

- Write tests for most files / classes
- Prioritize testing the main functionality of each class
- Repetitive tests for similar classes are nice to have, but lower priority
- Tests for every method are nice to have, but power priority
